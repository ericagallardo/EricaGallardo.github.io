                        <p>thanks for stopping by. My name is Erica and I am an international UX Researcher who is passionate about all things human-centered design.

I love using both qualitative and quantitative research methods to design interventions and influence the development of products for real people. My research has spanned from agricultural products in western Kenya, to education policy in Zambia, to formulative product research in the US.
